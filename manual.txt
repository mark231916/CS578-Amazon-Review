Libraries:
    Numpy, scikit-learn, pandas
Manual:
    The dataset folder contains original data:positive/negative_review.txt and pre-processed data(X.csv and y.csv). 
        Also, pre-trained models for running feature importance.
    The source folder contains a ProcessingData script to pre-process raw data; 
        main.py and feature_importance.py to run algorithms and to get results.
    To run the program, navigate to source folder and run main.py and feature_importance.py.
Notes on Running Time:
    The SVM algorithm takes a really long time because of its complexity. 
    You can comment SVM parts in main.py and feature_importance.py to save time.
